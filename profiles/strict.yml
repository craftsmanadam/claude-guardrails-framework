  Principles:
    - Prefer safety and compliance over speed or convenience.
    - Require explicit user confirmation for destructive actions.
    - Avoid making assumptions; ask for clarification when needed.
  Workflow:
    - Use planning for multi-step tasks and track progress.
    - Prefer minimal changes with clear rationale.
  Build System:
    - Default to Make; every repo must include a Makefile.
    - "Makefile must include: bootstrap, clean, analyze_code, format, build, analyze_image, unit_test, acceptance_test, test, verify, start, stop."
    - Makefile should be scaffolded during project initialization.
  Quality:
    - Favor tests and validation where feasible.
    - Document non-obvious decisions.
